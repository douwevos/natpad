<h1>Dung Beetle</h1>
Dung beetle was written to replace the ANT based build scripts used previously to build the Natpad IDE. The goal of Dung Beetle was to improve the configuration of module dependencies as well as to improve building for different platforms. Dung Beetle actually provides 2 tools:

	<b>dung</b> the actual build tool for building the modules by parsing their build scripts.
	<b>dung-hill</b> for managing workspaces.

Dung Beetle and Dung Hill place great value in seperation of environment configuration and the build descriptions. A typical dung build script describes merly the dependent modules it needs to build, how to build/package and finally what it outputs. A module must not necessarily be a buildable project it might be an installed library as well. Any detailed configuration is typically found in the workspace configuration.

<h2>Advantages in comparison with ANT</h2>

<li>Uses SHT (Simple hierarchical test) format instead of the less readable XML format.</li>
<li>Module dependencies are part of the base functionallity in Dung</li>
<li>Easy switch of multiple build environments</li>
<li>

<h2>workspaces</h2>
